# Zero-Fee Policy (Dead Space Chain)

- **User tx cost:** 0 â€” users pay nothing to interact (including claims).
- **How:** Sequencer sets base fee to zero and covers infra via block rewards (minted DEAD within the **666,666,666** cap or via a treasury allocation).
- **Publisher ops:** Proof publisher costs are also 0 on-chain; only the `setRoot` tx is required, done by the owner and subsidized by the chain (zero base fee).
