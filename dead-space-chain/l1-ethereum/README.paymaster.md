# Simple Paymaster (Skeleton)

This is a placeholder for an ERC-4337 paymaster if you decide to sponsor user gas for L1 claims.
It **does not** implement the EntryPoint interface. Before mainnet, replace with a real paymaster or a relayer.

- Fund with ETH if sponsoring.
- Use a relayer service to submit user operations or raw transactions.
- If you don't sponsor, users pay gas as normal (wallet supports that path).
