## Vision

- Turn **every wallet** into a **micro‑validator** (opt‑in) with **tiered roles**: Ghost (light), Wraith (medium), Titan (heavy).
- Reward **provable contributions** (DAS sampling, relay quality, fraud proofs, zk jobs) with **VoidStones ($VOID)**.
- Keep UX ethical and transparent (explicit opt‑in, resource caps, battery/CPU/net guards).
- “Project Monolith” is the R&D codename for consensus + agent primitives feeding the **VOID** network.

See `docs/VISION.md` and `docs/REWARD_SPEC.md` for details.
