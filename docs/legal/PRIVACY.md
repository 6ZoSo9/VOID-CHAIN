# Privacy Policy (Wallet & Node)

- We do **not** collect personal data by default.
- No telemetry/analytics are sent unless explicitly enabled in settings (off by default).
- If you enable optional diagnostics, data is limited to non-identifying logs and version info.
- Any future changes to data collection will be documented here and gated by explicit opt-in.
