# Governance (VOID / Obelisk)

- **BDFL (Project Lead):** ZoSo (6ZoSo9)
- Final decision authority on roadmap, merges, releases, and branding remains with the Project Lead.
- Maintainers may review PRs and recommend changes; merges occur only upon approval by the Project Lead.
- Disagreements may be recorded in issues; the Project Leadâ€™s decision is final to preserve project coherence.
